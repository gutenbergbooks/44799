BENJAMIN DISRAELI, EARL OF BEACONSFIELD, K.G.

ON of Isaac D'Israeli, author of _Curiosities of Literature_, of Jewish
extraction; born in London 21st December, 1805; published his political
novel, _Vivian Grey_, 1825; travelled in the East between 1828 and 1831;
contested Wycombe in 1831, and Marylebone, 1833, both unsuccessfully;
was returned for Maidstone, 1837; for Shrewsbury, 1841; for Bucks, 1847;
member of Sir R. Peel's party until Peel became a convert to Free
Trade, from which time Mr. Disraeli allied himself closely with the
Conservatives, of whom he became the leader in the House of Commons
after the death of Lord George Bentinck in 1848; conspicuous for his
attacks on Peel in Parliament; Chancellor of the Exchequer in Lord
Derby's first Ministry, 1852; and in his second, 1858-9; in 1859 brought
in a Reform Bill which was defeated by the Whigs; again Chancellor of
the Exchequer in Lord Derby's third Ministry, July, 1866; brought in a
second Reform Bill, based on Household Suffrage, which was passed, 1867;
on Lord Derby's resignation, February, 1868, became Prime Minister,
which office he resigned at the end of the year; on Mr. Gladstone's
Government resigning office, in consequence of their defeat on the Irish
University Bill, March, 1873, Mr. Disraeli was commissioned by the Queen
to form a Ministry, but declined to do so under the then circumstances.
On Mr. Gladstone appealing to the country in 1874, the election returns
placed him in a minority, and he resigned without meeting the new
Parliament; Mr. Disraeli succeeded him as Prime Minister and formed his
cabinet, March, 1874; created Earl of Beaconsfield, August, 1876; first
Plenipotentiary for Great Britain at the Congress of Berlin, 1878, and
K.G. Lord Beaconsfield's principal novels (besides _Vivian Grey_) are
_The Young Duke, Henrietta Temple, and Venetia_, and, since his entrance
on political life, _Coningsby, Sybil, Tancred, and Lothair._
